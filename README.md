# gRPC-Protobuff
In this, Bank System Example, To get grip on gRPC Framework, so i start doing practice and make a project to perform all type of gRPC such as 1to1 type, Client Streaming Type, Server Streaming Type, and last one is Bidirectional Stream type. 


After pulling this Example!

Way to start and run it!

-> Open it with any IDE (prefer IntelliJ)                                                                                                                                 
-> go to Main class and run the gRPC Server                                                                                                                               
-> go to Test classes, and then run test methods                                                                                                                                                            

-------------------------OR-----------------------                                                                                                                       
There is also a simple way is:                                                                                                                                           
                         -> Open it with any IDE (prefer IntelliJ)                                                                                                       
                         -> go to Main class and run the gRPC Server                                                                                                     
                         -> download BloomRPC (just know that it is like a API testing tool!), import all proto and run it!
